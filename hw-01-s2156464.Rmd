```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## **DO NOT EDIT THIS CODE CHUNK**
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#run install.packages("cherryblossom") on the console to get the run17 dataset

library(tidyverse)
library(cherryblossom)  
```



## Exercise 1

There are 19,961 runners in this data set, with 9 variables each. The net_sec 
variable gives the total time taken to complete the race, in seconds, once their 
run-time has been adjusted for the staggered starting times. The event variable 
refers to the type of race each individual has run, either a 10 mile or 5k.

## Exercise 2

```{r run17_data_viz, warning = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = run17, 
       mapping = aes(x = sex, y = net_sec), stat = "identity") +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~event) +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Total Running Time (s)")
```
